			Hello! I'm Lily, an incoming M.S. in Computer Science student at UC Davis. Just graduated with my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from UC Berkeley in May 2021, and I'm looking forward to exploring systems and machine learning topics at a graduate level, continuing to research, and potentially teaching undergrads. Recently, I've been obsessed with practical challenges in developing robust distributed systems, as can be seen from my <a href="./blog.html">posts</a>.

			<br />
			<br />

			I'm always, always open to speaking to students interested in STEM fields and / or applying to graduate school, specifically Master's degrees. Feel free to contact me if you find any mistakes in something I wrote, have any CS-related questions, etc. at <b>lbha at ucdavis dot edu</b>.
